# Clustering-algorithm

Objective:

The objective of this assessment is to evaluate my understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset

Use the Iris dataset available in seaborn

Key components  fulfilled :

1. Loaded and Preprocessed.

Loaded the Iris dataset from seaborn

Droped the species column since this is a clustering problem.

2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation 

Implement the following two clustering algorithms:

A) KMeans Clustering 

Provide a brief description of how KMeans clustering works.
and explained why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.

B) Hierarchical Clustering

Provided a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works.
and explained why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.
